Tile
=====

.. py:currentmodule:: PythonScreenStackManager.elements.baseelements


The tile element is a small :py:class:`TileElement`. It comes with an icon, text and a title.
It may be a little rough to use still since it was designed before the tile base element was written.
See the tutorial on :ref:`tutorial/designing:Tiles` for an explainer of working with the ``tile_layout`` property.
