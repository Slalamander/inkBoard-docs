CheckBoxes
===========

inkBoard provides a couple of elements which take on a boolean state.
These can best be seen as checkbox like elements, since they simply show whether they are *checked* or *unchecked* by changing the icon.
Although currently all elements here are based on :py:class:`Icon`, they will hopefully be extended in the future to include more types of elements.
