inkBoard Configuration
========================

.. entries to explain here:
.. inkBoard, logger, screen, small bit on the device

The entries explained here below can be considered the basic entries.

inkBoard
------------

The ``inkBoard`` entry configures some general settings for the dashboard.

.. currentmodule:: inkBoard.configuration.types

.. autoclass:: InkboardEntry
   :members:
   :no-index:
   :exclude-members: __init__

.. for screen: omit the device entry. Should be fine?
    Also should NOT show the members, just the doc string really
