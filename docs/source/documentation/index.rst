Documentation
==============

The documentation should cover everything you need to create a dashboard with inkBoard and get it running.
Both the basics for a configuration, all the types of elements, as well as documentation for integrations and platforms.

Not sure where to get started? If you have not followed it yet, take a look at the :doc:`tutorial </tutorial/index>`. 
Otherwise, use the platform ``emulator``, run the designer, and take a look at all the available elements to make a dashboard.

Since the project is still in development, some documented features may not actually be in use yet. A main factor of this is the Styling functionality, which needs to be properly overhauled first.

Don't forget to have a section for the entire configuration

For this page: take inspiration from the HA landing page
https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/

Maybe instead of a toc, use cards to make the base layout?
