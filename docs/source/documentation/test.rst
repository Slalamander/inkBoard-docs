Test page
==========

This page (or some page idk) should hold changes and improvement that will (hopefully) come at one point or another.

- Fully implement Styling, such that coherent themes can be created and applied.
- Change the ``inkBoard.core`` model to a class to prevent issues with importing and reloading
- Actually implement a test suite because good gods I keep breaking things
- Implement custom trigger functions for home Assistant elements
- Rewrite the MediaPlayer element
- May change terminology and variable names and the like in the future since they turned out to become confusing.
