============

With that, the inkBoard tutorial is finished. Hopefully it covered all the basic concepts required.
You can have a look at the final ``tutorial.yaml`` below. Yours will likely not be the exact same, but hopefully the basic structure is similar.

To "formally" conclude this tutorial, here are some (hopefully) useful links on where to go next.

- Go to :doc:`/elements/index` for all the base elements, and start designing a dashboard.
- Go to :doc:`/platforms/index` if you want to port your dashboard to a different platform.
- Go to :doc:`/integrations/index` to extend inkBoard with various integrations included with the designer.
- Go to :doc:`/integrations/homeassistant_client/index` if you are here from Home Assistant, and want to connect inkBoard to your home.
- Go to :doc:`cheatsheet` for a quick reference on everything that was just covered, and possibly more.
