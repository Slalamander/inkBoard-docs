Getting Started
===============

The base tutorial will take you through the steps to get an inkBoard dashboard up and running.
It will mainly focus on explaining some of the core concepts and features for the dashboarding system, integrations, and usage of custom functions and elements.
Considering the Home Assistant origins, the tutorial will follow a similar setup to the ESPHome tutorial, so starting at the very start, by installing Python. 

That part can be skimmed through if you know what you are doing, just take not of the highlighted blocks to make sure you don't miss anything important. As an aside, although the full configuration and folders for this will live in the repo, I advise following along with the tutorial yourself by copy/pasting the provided code blocks and editing the config file in your preferred IDE.

Any important concepts will be explained in these blocks, except for parts explaining the configuration of specific elements.

    This is an important concept

inkBoard (and inkBoard Designer) are confirmed to work in windows. Although it should work fine on Linux, it has not been tested on it yet. No guarantees can be made for Mac. 



.. When done with the entire documentation, maybe make the element names :ref:`Layout` or something.
