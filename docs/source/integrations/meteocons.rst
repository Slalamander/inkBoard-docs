Meteocons
===========

The meteocons integration is not directly usable (yet, at least) in a base inkBoard installation.
It is mainly meant to be used by other integrations that provide weather elements.
Although the mdi library has a lot of weather icons, it sometimes may just not fit your dashboard as well, for example.

The meteocons integration provides two additional sets of weather icons, filled and outlined.
The sets are from `Meteocons <https://bas.dev/work/meteocons>`_ by Bas Milius, although the package has been slimmed down.
Not all available icons are included and only one size has been packaged in order to keep the size managable.
The animated icons are not included either since inkBoard does not support animated images.
