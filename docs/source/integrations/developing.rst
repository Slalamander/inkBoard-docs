Developing Integrations
=========================


While I work on getting everything functional, the best reference on writing integrations would be the ``dummy_integration``.
That will eventually be laid out on this page, but not right now.

For the moment, look through its source codes and the comments I have made, which are hopefully sufficient for the moment to roughly explain what to do.

See the ``example/custom/integrations`` folder in the inkBoarddesigner repo for the files: `dummy_integration <https://github.com/Slalamander/inkBoarddesigner/tree/main/examples/custom/integrations/dummy_integration>`_
